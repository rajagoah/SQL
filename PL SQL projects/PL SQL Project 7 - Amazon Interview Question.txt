/*
STEP 1 --> Create a procedure
STEP 2 --> a variable of type table should be declared. The general data type of this table should be assigned as VARCHAR2.
STEP 3 --> in addition to this table variable, there are three other variables that are going t be declared. These three variables are being declared so that they can hold the values in those three cols.
Note that all the three additional variables should be of the tables datatype
STEP 4 --> We create an EXECUTE IMMEDIATE command to execute the Dynamic SQL. 
STEP 5 --> The output of the Dynamic SQL should be BULK COLLECTED INTO the three variables declared above.
STEP 6 --> to display the rows on console, we make use of a FOR loop. The length of time that the loop will run will be for the number of elements in any one of the variables of table data type.
STEP 7 --> We will be using DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE() function
STEP 8 --> the second BEING END block will be used to call the procedure */
