Filtering in JOIN vs WHERE

1. Consider the following two queries

A.	Applying the filter in where condition:

	SELECT A.VIN_FIRST_PART, A.CHASSIS_NBR, A.CLAIM_TOTAL, B.MODEL_YEAR
	FROM PRODZU.WVCTVCON A
	LEFT OUTER JOIN PRODZU.WVITVEHI B
	ON A.VIN_FIRST_PART = B.CHASSIS_1_10
	AND A.CHASSIS_NBR = B.CHASSIS_11_17
	WHERE A.MODEL_YEAR >= '2011'
	AND A.CLAIM_TOTAL <> 0
	AND B.CANADIAN_IND = 'N'

B.	Applying the filter in the join

	SELECT A.VIN_FIRST_PART, A.CHASSIS_NBR, A.CLAIM_TOTAL, B.MODEL_YEAR
	FROM PRODZU.WVCTVCON A
	LEFT OUTER JOIN PRODZU.WVITVEHI B
	ON A.VIN_FIRST_PART = B.CHASSIS_1_10
	AND A.CHASSIS_NBR = B.CHASSIS_11_17
	AND B.CANADIAN_IND = 'N'
	WHERE A.MODEL_YEAR >= '2011'
	AND A.CLAIM_TOTAL <> 0
	
a. Both the queries are distinctly different queries requesting for distinctly different results.
b. The query in 'A' filters on the result set returned after the join condition
C. The query in 'B' filters on the join table before the join is performed.
d. Only in case of an INNER JOIN, the result for both the queries will be the same. But if it is an OUTER JOIN, the results will vary.
e. The query in 'B' will not return any records where the CANADIAN_IND <> 'N'. Although it may be fine for this situation, it may not always be the case.
