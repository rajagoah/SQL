For loop in PL/SQL
The structure of FOR loop is as follows:

	FOR index IN lower_bound .. upper_bound
	LOOP
		<statements>
	END LOOP;

Here,
Index --> is the implicit variable that is local to the for loop
Lower_bound /Upper_bound --> lower and upper limit of the range within which 				the loop has to operate.
				Both these values are stored as temporary 				PLS_INTEGER.

EXAMPLE:
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
BEGIN
FOR l_counter IN 1 .. 5
LOOP
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(l_counter);
END LOOP;
END;	

EXAMPLE of REVERSE key word:
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
BEGIN
FOR l_counter IN REVERSE 1 .. 5
LOOP
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(l_counter);
END LOOP;
END;

EXAMPLE of using stepping variable to incrementing the variable 
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
DECLARE
V_STEP INTEGER := 2;
BEGIN
FOR l_counter IN 1 .. 5
LOOP
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(l_counter + v_step);
END LOOP;
END;
