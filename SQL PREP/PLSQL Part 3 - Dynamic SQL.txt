Substitution vs binding
Substitution --> When we have a SQL statement with a substitution variable represented with an '&', the interface being used to parse through the statement reads this substitution variable and prompts for the user to enter a suitable value BEFORE executing it.

Binding --> When we have SQL statement with a binding variable represented with a ':', the interface being used parses it and implicitly recognises that this statement has a binding variable and it will automatically apply the value being supplied to the binding variable through the arguments to the function
